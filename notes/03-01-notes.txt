USART / UART Serial COmmunication
USART = Universal Synchronous/Async Reciever/Transmitter
UART = Universal Async Receiver/Transmitter

Serial comm is simply a bit stream sent over a single wire (2 for bi-directional) to send or receive data

e.g. to send 8 bits of data over a thing:
start bit
  v        v stop bit
__         _
  _|||||||| 

| = high or low depending on bits of data

good exercise, try to have interrupt change the message being sent in main
instead of changing boolean flag
